## =ï¿½ Recommended Tech Stack

### Frontend (Current -  Already Setup)

- **React** - UI framework
- **Vite** - Build tool
- **Tailwind CSS** - Styling
- **React Router** - Navigation

### Backend Options (Choose One)

1. **Supabase** (Recommended for beginners)

   - Built-in auth with Google
   - PostgreSQL database
   - File storage
   - Real-time capabilities
   - Free tier available

2. **Firebase** (Alternative)

   - Google Auth integration
   - Firestore database
   - Cloud Storage
   - Hosting included

3. **Simple Static + Cloudflare** (Simplest)
   - Static site with hardcoded credentials
   - Cloudflare Pages for hosting
   - No database needed for simple use

## =ï¿½ Implementation Todo List

### Phase 1: Planning & Setup

- [ ] Choose backend solution (Supabase vs Firebase vs Static)
- [ ] Set up development environment
- [ ] Create basic project structure
- [ ] Set up Git workflow

### Phase 2: Core Features

- [ ] Design main layout and navigation
- [ ] Create document listing page
- [ ] Implement PDF viewer/download
- [ ] Add search functionality
- [ ] Create admin upload interface

### Phase 3: Authentication

- [ ] Set up Google Authentication
- [ ] Create protected routes
- [ ] Implement role-based access (if needed)
- [ ] Add simple admin panel

### Phase 4: Data Management

- [ ] Design document metadata schema
- [ ] Implement CRUD operations
- [ ] Add categories/tags for documents
- [ ] Create document management interface

### Phase 5: Production Ready

- [ ] Add error handling
- [ ] Implement loading states
- [ ] Add responsive design
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] SEO basics

### Phase 6: Deployment

- [ ] Set up environment variables
- [ ] Configure build process
- [ ] Deploy to hosting platform
- [ ] Set up custom domain
- [ ] Configure SSL

Architecture Decisions to Make

### 1. Authentication Strategy

**Options:**

- **Simple**: Single hardcoded admin password
- **Basic**: Google Auth with whitelist
- **Advanced**: Role-based permissions

**Recommendation**: Start with Google Auth + whitelist

### 2. Database Strategy

**Options:**

- **No Database**: Static files with JSON metadata
- **Simple Database**: Supabase with basic tables
- **Complex Database**: Full relational schema

**Recommendation**: Supabase with simple document metadata table

### 3. File Storage Strategy

**Options:**

- **Static**: Store PDFs in public folder
- **Cloud Storage**: Supabase Storage or Firebase Storage
- **CDN**: Cloudflare R2 or AWS S3

**Recommendation**: Start with Supabase Storage

## =ï¿½ MVP (Minimum Viable Product) Features

### Must Have

- [ ] List of available documents
- [ ] PDF download functionality
- [ ] Google authentication
- [ ] Mobile responsive design
- [ ] Admin upload interface

### Nice to Have

- [ ] PDF preview in browser
- [ ] Document search
- [ ] Categories/tags
- [ ] Document versioning
- [ ] User activity tracking

## =ï¿½ Success Metrics

- [ ] All documents accessible online
- [ ] Mobile-friendly interface
- [ ] Fast loading times (<3 seconds)
- [ ] Secure authentication
- [ ] Easy document management

## =' Development Tools You'll Need

- [ ] **VS Code** - Code editor
- [ ] **Git** - Version control
- [ ] **Node.js** - Runtime environment
- [ ] **Chrome DevTools** - Debugging
- [ ] **Postman** (if building API) - API testing

## =ï¿½ Questions for You to Consider

1. How many documents will you typically have? (affects database choice)
2. How often will documents be updated? (affects admin interface complexity)
3. Do you need user analytics/tracking?
4. What's your budget for hosting? (affects deployment choice)
5. How technical do you want to get? (affects architecture complexity)

## <ï¿½ Next Steps

1. **Choose your backend approach** (I recommend Supabase for learning)
2. **Set up basic React routing**
3. **Create mockup of main interface**
4. **Implement authentication**
5. **Add document management**
