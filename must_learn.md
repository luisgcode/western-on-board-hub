# üìö Must Learn - Personal Learning Notes

## ‚úÖ JavaScript Fundamentals (Completed)

### Arrays vs Objects - Data Organization
**When I learned this**: Working on documents.js structure

**Key insight**: 
- **Arrays** `[]` = Filing cabinet (multiple similar things)
- **Objects** `{}` = Folder (one thing with details)
- **Array of Objects** = Best for document lists

**Example that works**:
```javascript
const documents = [
  { id: 1, name: "Employee Handbook", category: "HR" },
  { id: 2, name: "IT Setup", category: "Tech" }
]
```

## üéØ Current Study Topics

### JavaScript Array Methods (In Progress)
**Resource**: [Array Methods Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8rmfD9Y5-c)
**Goal**: Master `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, `find`

**My notes**:
- `map()` = Transform each item
- `filter()` = Keep items that match condition  
- `reduce()` = Combine all items into one result
- `find()` = Get first item that matches

**Practice examples**:
```javascript
// Filter documents by category
documents.filter(doc => doc.category === "HR")

// Get just the names
documents.map(doc => doc.name)

// Find specific document
documents.find(doc => doc.id === 1)
```

**Struggles/Questions**:
- [ ] When to use `reduce()` vs `map()`?
- [ ] How does `filter()` + `map()` work together?

### Understanding Transformers (Next)  
**Resource**: [Hugging Face Course Ch1](https://huggingface.co/course/chapter1)
**Goal**: Understand how AI processes text

**My notes**:
*(Add notes as you study)*

**Key questions to answer**:
- What are tokens vs words?
- How does AI "understand" text?
- What's a context window?
