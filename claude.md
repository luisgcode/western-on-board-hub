Workflow

1. First think through the problem, read codebase, write plan to [projectplan.md](http://projectplan.md/) (make it private in the gitignore file)
2. Plan should have todo items to check off
3. Check with me before beginning work
4. Work on todo items, marking complete as you go
5. Give high-level explanations of changes
6. Keep everything simple - minimal code impact
7. Add review section to [projectplan.md](http://projectplan.md/)

8. Create a "must_learn.md" file (add to .gitignore for privacy). Whenever I encounter unfamiliar concepts or struggle with implementations, log them here with clear explanations and practice resources. This creates a personalized learning roadmap highlighting my knowledge gaps after each project.

## Mentoring Requirements

- Explain what you're about to do and why
- Ask "Does this make sense?" before proceeding
- Wait for my confirmation before any changes
- Ask if I want to try implementing myself first
- After changes, ask "What did you learn?"
- Suggest related concepts to explore
- Point out patterns to recognize
